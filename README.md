# 🌊 RAGLens — Enterprise RAG Evaluation
# 📘 NFIP Flood Insurance RAG Chatbot (450-Page Policy Manual)

Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering System for Complex Regulatory Documents


## 🚀 Project Overview
RAGLens is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to answer user questions exclusively from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) Flood Insurance Manual (October 2025 edition) published by FEMA.
This system enables users—such as policyholders, insurance analysts, researchers, and students—to query a 450-page regulatory document and receive accurate, source-grounded answers without manually searching dense policy text.
