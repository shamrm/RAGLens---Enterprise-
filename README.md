# NFIP Flood Insurance RAG Chatbot(450 page document)

##Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering System

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to answer user questions based exclusively on the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) Flood Insurance Manual (10/2025).

The chatbot enables users—such as policyholders, analysts, and researchers—to query complex insurance documentation and receive accurate, source-grounded responses directly from the official NFIP manual

## Use Case & Impact

This chatbot demonstrates how RAG-based NLP systems can be applied to complex regulatory and insurance documentation to:

-Reduce manual search through dense policy text
-Improve accessibility of flood insurance information
-Support analysts and users with consistent, explainable answers
-Minimize hallucinations by grounding responses in official FEMA documentation
